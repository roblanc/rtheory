There are 3 main pillars when searching for information in the Digital Era:

1. What are you searching for?
2. Passive VS. Active Information Gathering
3. Paying attention to your biases when doing research

### What are you searching for?

You need to find pre-digested information. This is the most authentic version of the data. If someone sends you a link provided by a huge media outlet, one should investigate the contents of the link. For historical information, places like Wikipedia can be a decent starting point. Smaller communities on Quora and Reddit (r/AskHistory). Historians are willing to engage with questions + good for finding PhDs & specialists answering specific historical questions.

### Passive VS. Active Information Gathering

Passive Information = scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Twitter, and being bombarded with 15 sec. meme videos meant to derail you and make a profit.

To keep in mind — the goal of your timelines is to maximize the view time & how much they can monetize you. The idea that it needs to be factually correct is left behind. Usually, mainstream media sources are decent at reporting factually correct info. They might spin it, selectively report things, but it is rare they will publish an outright lie.

### Paying attention to your biases when doing research

Getting fact-based reporting from different sources can be good but beware of interpretations. Some might include Reuters or the Associated Press. Take your time, don’t jump to conclusions.

> Person A: “I’ve read 100 studies on X.”
>
> Person B: “No, you haven’t. Because, most likely, there are not 100 studies, to begin with.”

People are not aware of this, but there aren’t usually that many studies published about a niche topic. In any given field, there’s going to be 1–5 big studies or meta-analyses summarizing a bunch of research. You will often find that news is recycling the same study, but spinning its contents to fit their agenda, adding bombastic headlines and trigger words. News articles will probably use the same study to sustain themselves, a study that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine or The Lancet. When you read something like “researchers have found out X” — providing they are linking the name of the researchers and research paper, it is simply more rational to read the original piece instead.

Simply copy-paste the name of the study, find the PDF, read it, and then you can read the news article to see if it makes sense. Don’t overreach your position if it goes further than your realm of knowledge.

Don’t trust entities telling you that they are giving you access to both sides of the issue because usually, these people have political slants. I say this on the internet, so you should not trust me either.

What do you do if you are wrong? Never expect anybody to change their mind on the spot. It should not matter if your opinion is wrong, because you should be tied to the outcomes, not the processes. This can also go in reverse because if you have first-hand experience with that topic, it might be that you have better arguments than you can give because of that first-hand experience.

Also, have conversations with your friends. Google people that are known for making X arguments. Keep yourself humble. Remember to maintain the balance. The amount of information you can voraciously gather now is probably not going to overtake what you can collect in 2–3 days.
