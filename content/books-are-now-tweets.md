I wanted to get back into reading evergreen books.

I recognize that this is a difficult problem to solve because my brain has been rewired and trained to spend time on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and another handful of these places serving you bite-sized pieces of content.

So I came up with a technique in which I began to treat books as if they were blog posts to be read on the fly, or as bite-sized tweets or Facebook posts to be shared. Nothing fancy, but a simple mental switch I reinforce every day. Habit building. I no longer feel obligated to finish any books. I’m free to pursue other interests.

If someone mentions a book to me, I will purchase it, most often in eBook format, which will be stored as a digital file in my personal knowledge repository.  
  
I’m currently reading summaries and snippets from tens or even hundreds of books at a time. A spider’s web pulsing through each tiny fiber is a metaphor for the knowledge that is up and interconnected in the world. I’m constantly flipping, skimming, adjusting, speeding things up, slowing them down, and boiling things to the point of dehydration and death. I’ll either start a book in the middle or finish it from beginning to end.

I’m not sure what it was about the book that caught my attention while I was flipping through it in the public library.

**I don’t feel obligated to finish reading the book.**

I treat books as if they were mere pieces of information that I could easily discard and throw away back into the world.

It’s all about compression.
